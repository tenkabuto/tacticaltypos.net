Apparently Leanpub now requires a specific type of paid account or lifetime membership in order to make new books and write them with Dropbox or Github. Thankfully I had some extra books that I'd created in the past but never worked on, and they were apparently grandfathered in, so now I've repurposed an old one to publish *[[Juices There]]*.
