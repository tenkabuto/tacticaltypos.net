Very good explanation of how to setup the GitHub Actions: https://alexwilson.tech/content/717e6a35-1cb5-4a28-9321-592d05ddd9dc
- likely wouldn't need the test step
- this goes way deep into using artifacts from testing, but I don't want that
	- [ ] look at other articles for how to push to gh-pages from build command
		- this takes us most of the way there: https://kaizendorks.github.io/2020/04/16/vuepress-github-actions/
		- it looks like we can just use this instead of the manual process for deploying mentioned in the above link: https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages
			- add cname file: https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-add-cname-file-cname
			- this example takes us most of the way there, but it relies on a requirements.txt file, which I may need to look into adding: https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-static-site-generators-with-python
				- generate a requirements.txt file with the command mentioned here: https://learnpython.com/blog/python-requirements-file/
				- specify a GitHub repo as a package, for my version of lettersmith: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35998253
					- use the https or ssh versions here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/34518202
					- install pip package from git repo: https://adamj.eu/tech/2019/03/11/pip-install-from-a-git-repository/
	- [ ] use other parts of this article to piece together the required action
- might need a step that uses setup-python, if that exists
- install my version of lettersmith
- cache pip
- checkout master repo branch
- use deploy command

Setup python with this:

- full docs for Python: http://www.gregreda.com/2020/12/09/deploying-static-sites-with-github-actions/

Finally got the GitHub Pages to refresh after changing my GitHub Pages settings to generate the site according to a branch, gh-pages. I'd had it set to GitHub Actions, but that never appeared in the deployments area. However, my GitHub action still gets run successfully and updates the gh-pages branch, so it does actually work.
