## Ongoing
- This website, for one
- [[Skateboarding Analytics]]: Towards a way of recording, analyzing, and visualizing data about skateboarding trick attempts and a skateboarder's likelihood of landing a trick. Progression (or regression), visualized!
- Page about independent research: [[Independent Scholarship]]
- [[Juices There]] (book): A wildly inefficient but nonetheless fun and sometimes funny way to learn and practice Spanish. Use phonetics, rhyming, vocabulary, and creativity to play with the languages of English and Spanish.

### On Hold
- Mind Set (book? webpage?)
- PeerJoy (website/social networking service)

## Considering
- Writing essays for this [[Call for Abstracts - Skateboarding and Philosophy book]], or writing ones inspired by it under the header of Think Skate, which I might turn into [an ebook](https://leanpub.com/thinkskate)
