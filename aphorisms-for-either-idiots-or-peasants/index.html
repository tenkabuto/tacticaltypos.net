        <h1 class="blog-post-title">Aphorisms for Either Idiots or Peasants</h1>
        <p>A collection of aphorisms that I've come up with (and maybe a few that've I quoted from other people).</p>
<p>Published here: <a href="https://leanpub.com/aphorisms-for-idiots-or-peasants">https://leanpub.com/aphorisms-for-idiots-or-peasants</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Status: I'm in the process of updating this by reviewing the old version and revising it with new aphorisms that I've come up with since I last published it. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Why It's Good to be Sorta Blind without Glasses&quot;, &quot;The Nearly Lost Art of Getting Figuratively Punched in the Face&quot;, &quot;To Whom the Person in the Mirror Laughs At&quot;, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This book is a pile of particularly good rubbish that I add to from time to time. I either made or synthesized the rubbish myself or heard or red the rubbish from someone else. In the latter case, I have noted who said or wrote whatever it is.</p>
<p>For some of the aphorisms, I provide information about the context within which the aphorism was shared and how it possibly should be understood or used as a tool for further thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>To be compiled</h2>
<p>Even if something is right behind you, you've still turned your back to it.</p>
<p>Gotta play the game to feel the luck.</p>
<p>As nice as that tree is, it is not the one to be barking up at. (Regarding dating someone with redflags you can't or shouldn't overlook.)</p>
<p>Do not start telling yourself that she <em>is</em> life or that she <em>is</em> love. She is not life and she is not love. No one person ever could be either of those things. But she is a reminder of life and love, of what it means to live and to love. (Not super aphoristic, though it may make for a good quote or advice.)</p>
<p>I don't need you. I just want to experience life with you for as long as you'll let me.</p>
<p>Be yourself first and be able to love that, irrespective of whether someone else loves you or finds you lovely. Be your own kind of lovely.</p>
<p>Their actions may destroy your body, but only your actions may destroy your soul.</p>
<p>To be a mystery to others is one thing, but to be a mystery to oneself leaves everyone confused.</p>
<p>Love begets love.</p>
<p>We may speak to our past selves and ask questions of our future selves.</p>
<p>Serve not the wise but wisdom itself.</p>
<h2>Aphorisms in general</h2>
<p>An aphorism is the very crest of a wave, the distillation of a train of thought.</p>
<h2>Aphorisn't - Unpacking and scrutinizing selfmade aphorisms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reader reflections on the aphorisms that lend a different perspective on the thing. That the aphorism may register to you as being true, but it seems true because of a wildly different reason or scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a weird thing that my aphorisms tend to be in the form of a command, telling one to do this or that.</p>
