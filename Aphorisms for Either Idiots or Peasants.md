A collection of aphorisms that I've come up with (and maybe a few that've I quoted from other people).

Published here: <https://leanpub.com/aphorisms-for-idiots-or-peasants>

- Status: I'm in the process of updating this by reviewing the old version and revising it with new aphorisms that I've come up with since I last published it. 

> "Why It's Good to be Sorta Blind without Glasses", "The Nearly Lost Art of Getting Figuratively Punched in the Face", "To Whom the Person in the Mirror Laughs At", and more.

> This book is a pile of particularly good rubbish that I add to from time to time. I either made or synthesized the rubbish myself or heard or red the rubbish from someone else. In the latter case, I have noted who said or wrote whatever it is.
>
> For some of the aphorisms, I provide information about the context within which the aphorism was shared and how it possibly should be understood or used as a tool for further thought.
