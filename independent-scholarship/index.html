        <h1 class="blog-post-title">Independent Scholarship</h1>
        <p>Drilling into what it means to be a scholar, irrespective of whether you're affiliated with an academic institution or not.</p>
<p>See the page <a href="https://tacticaltypos.net/my-independent-scholarship/" class="wikilink">My Independent Scholarship</a> for information about my attempts to be/become a scholar.</p>
<p>Some of this is oriented towards acquiring research skills necessary to do research on your own. Like learning what you'd get from a PhD program, but on your own.</p>
<p>As in <a href="https://scholar.social/@bthall/106582136990272430">my discussion from July 2021</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From talking with professors and people who went to grad school (mostly PhDs, I think), my impression has been that in grad school / while pursuing their PhDs, beyond acquiring more knowledge about their field, they learned/developed an interesting sense of thinking about problems and a mindset or orientation towards addressing them that I haven't quite found among people that haven't gone through the grad school / PhD process.</p>
<p>For those of you that have had that experience or perceived it in others, please let me know and give me a description of it.</p>
<p>I've heard things about grad school that suggest to me that I might not want to go through the experience (highly political and stressful), but I'm quite interested in developing/acquiring for myself what I have perceived in others who have gone through it.</p>

<p>It seems to be much less frequent that a person with only a Bachelor's degree or less chooses and persists with the independent researcher life. It seems to be possible but difficult, especially in infrastructure-heavy fields like physics.</p>

<p>As a possibly conservative estimate, for every 1 professor in academia, there might be 1 person that's outside of academia who is interested in doing academic/scholarly things. Assuming only that much, you have a basic sense of the size of the market for such materials. (This relates well to <span class="nolink">PeerJoy</span> estimates of people with interests in area.)</p>
