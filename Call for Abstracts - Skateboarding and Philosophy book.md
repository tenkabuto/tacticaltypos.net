summary: "Call for Abstracts for submissions to a book about Skateboarding and Philosophy. Abstracts are due by August 7, 2023."
---

Below is a Call for Abstracts that was recently emailed to me.[^seent] Please review it and consider submitting an abstract for it.

I don't know yet whether I'll contribute to this, but the request seems to have given me some permission to think more about these topics than I'd apparently been allowing myself to do, despite evidently wanting to. 😁 I might end up writing my own things in response to some of these prompts and put them on this site or in an ebook of my own.

[^seent]: Apparently I've sufficiently established myself online at the cross-roads of both interests, skateboarding and philosophy!

Potential topics may include (_but are not limited to_)...
>

> 
> _Rebellion_: What is the relationship between skateboarding and (say) punk rock? Is skateboarding inherently rebellious?
> 
> _Philosophy of Sport_: Is skateboarding a sport (and, what _is_ a sport)? Does it matter? How does skateboarding different from other sports or athletic feats? Should skateboarding be in the Olympics?
> 
> _Judgment_: How should the winners in skateboarding competitions be judged?
> 
> _Authenticity_: should skateboarders care about “selling out”? What does it even mean to “sell out”?
> 
> _Ethics_: Should boarders be skating on public property? Do they have a moral obligation to obey “No Skateboarding” signs? Should children be encouraged (or allowed) to participate in dangerous sports such as skateboarding?
> 
> _Risk Management_: Is it irrational for skateboarders to take some of the risks that they do? Where is the line between bravery and stupidity?
> 
> _Aesthetics_: Is skateboarding an art? Is skateboarding a creative venture? In what sense (if any) are skateboarders artists or creatives? Can skateboarding be beautiful? How does the notion of “good” skateboarding evolve? How do standards and measures change (and must they)?

> 
> _Gender and Sexuality_: Have women been unfairly marginalized in skateboarding culture? How can skateboarding be used for empowerment?

> _Language and Meaning_: What does the evolution of trick names teach us about language? What does “frontside/backside” mean? Why does it change in a nollie or fakie? Definite descriptions and reference. Does “backside 1620” refer to anything? Is it meaningful?
> 
> _Social Philosophy_: Is it possible to be a poser? Or, how to be an authentic skater.
> 
> _Metaphysics_: What kind of thing is a skateboard trick?
