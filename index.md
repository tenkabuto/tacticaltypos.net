Hello, this is the homepage of the website for Brandon Hall, a [Christian](my-christianity), [philosopher](experience-as-philosopher), and [economist](experience-as-economist).

I am a philosopher that often uses the tools of [[economics|Economics]], [[statistics|Statistics]], and technology for analysis and critique. I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from [California State University, Sacramento](https://www.csus.edu/econ/) in the Fall of 2018.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Here, I try to refine my thinking about a variety of topics and collect content that I post elsewhere, but in a more reader-friendly and structured format.

You can find me at the following places. Please reach out to me there.
